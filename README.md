# api-pokemon
This API is the result of one interesting project into Platzi Master where two Frontends and I had to build a "Pokedex" that gives users basic information about the Pokemons up to who they could convert into a legendary Pokemon.

My part in this project was:
- I had to extract the information of pokemons from a data frame on Kaggle y complement it with data from the official web of Pokemon for this I used a scrapper. With information complete, 
- I had to clean the data and analyze them to know whom pokemon were more strong and who could convert into a legendary Pokemon, for this I used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn
- Then I had to make an API REST using Django, Django Rest Framework, and PostgreSQL to give the endpoints to the Frontend
